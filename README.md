This repository contains modifications to the original code of this very old version of kh-coder that is still used by our research team.

DISLAIMER: our use of this code remains strictly for academic and research purposes. We may have to distribute this version of kh-coder to third-party researchers and if so the modified source code will be distributed in whole and without restrictions, with a copy of the GPLv2 license and with visible references to the upstream repository.

We kindly want to thanks the original collaborators and community behind kh-coder and engage in promoting the open source ecosystem that surrounds it.
